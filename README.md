Pubcrawler is a way to create and share pub crawls across the city of Melbourne. 

Pubcrawler will intelligently suggest the best establishments based on your location, capacity, reviews and local crime data and allow you to create a list of pubs to visit. 

You can also see popular crawls and rate them.
